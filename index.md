## Who We Are

**Sakaguchi laboratory** (originally Araki-Sakaguchi laboratory) has been researching in wireless technology, since 1995. Founded on wireless communication systems, the lab has been extended widely from theoretical analysis to hardware implementation, measurement system construction and empirical experiments and from domestic to international research collaboration.
Moreover, not only academic works within the university, but also co-works with various famous industrial domestic/international companies have been conducted for developing new wireless applications and contributing to the next generation wireless system standards.
In the future, the laboratory will especially dedicate to researches on 5G cellular networks and IoT based tactile Internet including localization for indoor/outdoor autonomous driving and wireless power transmission.
